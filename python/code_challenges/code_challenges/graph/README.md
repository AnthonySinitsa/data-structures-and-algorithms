class graph instantiates a graph,

add_vertex adds vertex(node) to graph

add_edge adds an edge between vertices with a specified weight

get_vertices returns all vertices in graph as a collection

get_neighbors return collection of edges connected to given vertex

size return total number of vertices in graph

vertex is the Node of graphs, edge is the path between vertexes

## test
